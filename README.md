# hello-world

Hello,

This is a readme file. It is considered to be read by a reader.

I wrote this because the "Hello World" Guide from Github told me to do so. There is absolutely nothing about this repository and it is completely pointless. So if you don't want to waste your precious time, go on and discover other great and non-redundant contributes on Github.
